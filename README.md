- Hello, I'm Vince, fine with being called Red or Dred. Pretty much you can call me anything just don't make it weird.

  - 16, Birthday is August 20th.

- Interests. Well, I have many and at this point I can't keep up with them all. Multifandom. Other than that, I play the electric guitar and do art.
 
 - As for Pony Town, Please don't copy my skins. I'm not that strict when it comes to that but at least ask if you want to take inspo. If it's a joke skin of mine and you wanna copy it, than go for it.
